# svelte-mtg-calculator
 mtg hypergeometric distribution calculator. 

 Notes/to do
 - Fix category name method so it's index-based, and does not require unique text names. 
 - Figure our accurate mulligan method.
 - Extend linking logic so it's not capped at 4 categories. 
 - Support adding more turns. 

 Nice to haves
 - fancier link/multivariate logic, such as OR operator (what are the chances I draw a plains and an island, OR a dual land).
 - Group linked cards in the output visual in some way (connector line, within a box, even just adjacent)
 - Support variable draws per turn? (what if I have a lot of cantrips, scry, early-game draw, etc). 
 - Some kind of integration with moxfield tags... (auto-group)

Mulligan challenge
